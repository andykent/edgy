		<h1>Edgy - Keeping you on the edge of your seat!</h1>
		<p>Edgy was born of a desire to have an easy way for keeping up to date with all the latest gems from their source code repositories.</p>
		<p>Installing Edgy works like this&hellip;</p>
		<code>
			<pre>sudo gem install sake
sake -i 'http://edgy.4ninjas.org/edgy.sake'				
			</pre>
		</code>
		<p>Using it works like this&hellip;</p>
		<code>
			<pre>sake edgy:version # see the current edgy version that's installed
sake edgy:list # shows all available packages
sake edgy:build packages="rspec merb do dm"	# install the rspec,merb, data objects and data mapper packages from GitHub edge.
			</pre>
		</code>
		<p>Notes: This has only been tested on OSX Leopard &amp; not very thoroughly. Currently only GIT repositories are supported but SVN support will be coming soon.<br />
			Please send your package suggestions to Andy Kent (candyco) andrew.d.kent [at] gmail</p>
